/**
 * The registry of PTCGP expansion sets — the single source of set metadata for
 * the whole app, imported from the ptcgp-deck-builder project.
 *
 * The registry lists every *published* set (A1 through B3b) so ordering,
 * labels, and coverage assertions work even before a set's card data is seeded
 * under `data/`. It is deliberately *not* `server-only`: it is small metadata
 * that client components (e.g. the set filter) may import directly rather than
 * hardcoding set names. Card data itself stays server-tier (see catalog.ts).
 *
 * Not included: the upcoming B4 (Ruler of the Skies — card count still TBA) and
 * the Promo sets (P-A / P-B). Add a row here when a set is published.
