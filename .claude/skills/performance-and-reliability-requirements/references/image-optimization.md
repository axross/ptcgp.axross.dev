# Asset and Image Optimization

Apply these rules to verify images and other large assets are sized, formatted, and rendered through the framework's optimized asset pipeline. Map "the optimized image component/pipeline" to whatever Next.js provides.

## Optimized Image Pipeline Usage

Images dominate page weight, and a raw image element ships one fixed file to every device regardless of viewport, pixel density, or format support.

- Read intrinsic dimensions from the source (a static asset or content frontmatter) where available, and fall back to the unoptimized path only when dimensions are unknown. Match the project's existing image-rendering pattern.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a new unit renders a raw, unoptimized image element for any bundled asset or image from a known external host. Use the framework's optimized image pipeline.
- MUST flag a Major when an optimized image is rendered without intrinsic dimensions (or the framework's fill/intrinsic-sizing mode) — without dimensions the pipeline falls back to unoptimized output and ships a layout-shift-prone image.

## Unoptimized-Path Discipline

The unoptimized path skips the byte savings and the host-allowlist check at once, so reaching for it is a performance and a security decision in the same line.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when the unoptimized image path is used with a user-controlled URL whose host is not in the project's allowlist of permitted external image hosts. Cross-reference with the project's application-security requirements (ssrf-and-embeds rules).
- MUST flag a Major when the unoptimized path is used for an image whose dimensions are known (a field on the record, or a static asset). Optimization saves bandwidth — unoptimized should be a fallback, not a default.

## Loading and Priority

Loading hints tell the browser which bytes gate first paint, so a wrong hint either delays the largest visible element or spends bandwidth on imagery nobody has scrolled to.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Major when a new above-the-fold image is rendered without a priority/eager hint (or with lazy loading). Such imagery should load eagerly.
- MUST flag a Major when a new below-the-fold image is rendered without lazy loading. Match the project's existing body-content image pattern.

## External Image Host Allowlist

Each allowlist entry authorizes the optimizer to fetch and process bytes from an external origin on demand, so entry breadth is attack surface and cost surface, not convenience.

**Guidelines:**

- MUST flag a Critical when a new permitted external image host uses a wildcard hostname or omits a path scope. Keep entries tightly scoped to a specific host and path prefix.
- MUST flag a Major when the pattern's protocol is insecure (plain HTTP) for a non-local host. Production images should be HTTPS only.
